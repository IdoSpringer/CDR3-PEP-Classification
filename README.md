# TCR-peptide attachment prediction

We aim to know, given a pair of a T-Cell Receptor (TCR) and an epitope peptide,
if the TCR will bind the peptide. This is a binary classification problem.
Our models use the data to predict a probability of attachment between a given TCR and a peptide.

## Datasets
