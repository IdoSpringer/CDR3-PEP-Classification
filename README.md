# TCR-peptide attachment prediction

We aim to know, given a pair of a T-Cell Receptor (TCR) and an epitope peptide,
if the TCR will bind the peptide. This is a binary classification problem.
Our models use the data to predict a probability of attachment between a given TCR and a peptide.

## Datasets

- [ ] details for 3 datasets - Weizmann, VDJdb (Shugay), cancer
- [ ] data_stats.md

## Models

### LSTM encoding
### TCR Autoencoder  
### MLP Classifier

## Results

###  AUC Results (3 datasets, 2 models)

### (more results needed)
